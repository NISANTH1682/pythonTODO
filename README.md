This Project is a simple To-Do Application built using Python's tkinter library. The application allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as complete using checkboxes, and switch between viewing incomplete and completed tasks.
Add Task: enter a new task using a text entry box and add it to the list of incomplete tasks.
Mark as Complete: Each task in the "Incomplete Tasks" list comes with a checkbox. Once the checkbox is checked, the task moves to the "Completed Tasks" list.
Task View Toggle: You can switch between viewing incomplete tasks and completed tasks using separate buttons.
Error Handling: If the user tries to add an empty task, an error message is shown.
